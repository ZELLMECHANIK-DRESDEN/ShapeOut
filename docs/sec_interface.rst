User Interface

Menu bar
========

- File:
   - Find Measurements: opens a project (including all samples with all
     measurements) or a single sample (including all measurements).
     Open and choose the "YYMMDD_Project Leader_Sample" folder to open
     a whole project or a "SampleName" folder to open all measurements of
     a sample
   - Add Measurement: adds another project or sample to the already
     loaded measurements
   - Clear Measurements: removes all samples or measurements, which are
     not selected in the measurement browser.
   - Save session: saves the status of the analysis
   - Load session: loads a saved session
   - Quit: quits the program

- Export:
   - All event data (\*.tsv): tool to export datasets (filtered, unfiltered,
     specified parameters only)
   - Graphical plot (\*.pdf): exports all plots in a pdf file
   - Computed statistics (\*.tsv): exports the statistics in a table

- Batch: Batch analysis of datasets

- Help: Help and information for debugging


Measurement browser and data selector
=====================================
The browser shows the opened projects and the corresponding measurements
(in an expandable tree structure). The name of the measurement is
composed of the measurement number, the measurement region and the flow rate.
For easy selection of measurements, you can use the buttons below the browser
(e.g. you can select all data for a certain flow rate). 

**Analyze button:**
The Analyze button plots all selected data either as raw data or using
the filter settings.


Session tabs
============
Information tab
---------------
Shows all saved measurement properties. Several properties are only
highlighted if a single measurement is analyzed. If properties differ
between single measurements this is indicated by "(multiple)". Use the
scroll bars or adjust the pane or increase the size of the pane by
dragging of the edge to see the full table.

General
.......
Cell Number:
  number of recorded cells. In ShapeIn this number is shown on the front
  panel "Number of cells measured".

Channel Width:
  dimension of the channel. This number is not detected automatically
  by the system, but has to be set by hand in ShapeIn on the front panel
  under "Channel dimension [µm]".

Flow Rate:
  is the sum of sheath and sample flow in µl/s. ShapeIn records this
  number when the measurement starts and shows it on the front panel
  under "Flow Rate [µl/s]".

Measurement Number:
  is the number of the measurement within the opened project. In ShapeIn
  this number is shown on the front panel under "current/next #"

Region:
  shows the position of the Region-of-interest during the measurement.
  This is not detected automatically by the system, but has to be set
  by hand in ShapeIn on the front panel under "Region of interest in the …".

Sample Flow Rate and Sheath Flow Rate:
  are the flow rates of the sample and sheath flow in µl/s, respectively.

Image
.....
Cell Aspect Max:
  gating parameter for maximum aspect ratio = length/height. Here, length
  defines the extension of cell in flow direction and the height the
  extension of the cell transverse to the channel.

Cell Aspect Min:
  gating parameter for minimum aspect ratio = length/height. Here, length
  defines the extension of cell in flow direction and the height the
  extension of the cell transverse to the channel.

Cell Max Height / Length / Min:
  shows the gate that was set in ShapeIn to exclude cells larger / smaller
  than this number. In ShapeIn these numbers are shown in the normal tab
  under Gating tools.

Pix Size:
  resolution of the microscope-camera-system in [µm/pixels]. In ShapeIn
  this number is shown in the expert tab under Expert settings and
  "Resolution [µm/pix]".

Thresh:
  grey value used as a threshold for each pixel of the image after
  subtracting the background image. All pixels above the threshold
  form the binary image. In ShapeIn under Expert settings "min grey threshold".

Trig Thresh:
  minimum number of pixels within the binary image to be further
  processed in cell analysis. In ShapeIn under Expert settings
  "min pixels threshold".

Framerate
.........
Frame Rate:
  of the camera during the measurement. ShapeIn records this information
  when the measurement starts and shows it in the Expert tab under
  Camera tools and "Framerate [Hz]".

ROI
...
Height / Width:
  of the region of interest in pixels. ShapeIn records this information
  when the measurement starts. It is set automatically or manually
  in the Expert tab under Camera tools and "Height [pix]"/ "Width [pix]".

Filtering tab
-------------
In this tab, you can filter your data by excluding values beyond certain
limits. Select the Enable Filters check box on the right and hit the
Apply/Reset button to apply/reset the settings. The Box Filters limit
the range of parameters; the Polygon Filters allow freely defining a
gate by a polygon in the current plot. The filters are applied to the
whole data set, independently of the actual shown plot. At least one
event has to be within the limits or the program shows an error.

Box Filters
........... 
Minimum and maximum values for box filters are set to 0.0 by default.
As long as min and max values equal 0.0, the filter is not applied.
On the left of the table the minimum value is set, on the right the
maximum. If you set a minimum, you have to set a maximum as well,
otherwise all data points are gated out.

Range Area:
  limits the cell size in [µm²].

Range Area Ratio:
  defines the relative difference between convex hull area and cell area.
  "1": convex hull and area
  contour are the same, "<1": forbidden, because the convex hull cannot
  be smaller than the contour. The minimum value is only effective ">1".

Range Aspect:
  limits the ratio of height and length of the bounding box around
  the contour of the cell (see Figure below).

  .. figure:: figures/aspect.jpg

Range Defo:
  limits the deformation

Range Pos Lat:
  limits the lateral position of a contour in the region of interest

Range Pos x:
  limits the position in direction of channel axis in the region of interest

Range Time:
  limits a number of time frames within the measurement in [s].

Range x-size:
  limits the size in x direction (width)

Range y-size:
  limits the size in y direction (height)
