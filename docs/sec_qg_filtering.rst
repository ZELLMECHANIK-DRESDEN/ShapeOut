========================
Excluding invalid events
========================
Filters can be used to exclude invalid events, such as cell debris,
cell doublets or larger aggregates, or cells that are not intact, from
an analysis.

- **Area:**

  The event area (the area defined by the event contour) can be used to
  filter cell aggregates (larger area), dead or degenerate cells, as well
  as cell debris (small area). Use the deformation versus area plot to
  identify exclusion candidates by clicking on an event and visualizing
  it in the event area.

       Examples of events with small or large areas.


- **Aspect ratio:**

  remove cell clusters

- **Orientation:**

  only cells aligned with channel

- **Porosity:**

  Remove debris
