Installation
============
Shape-Out can be installed via multiple channels.

1. **Windows installer:** Download the latest version for your architecture
   (e.g. ``ShapeOut_X.Y.Z_win_64bit_setup.exe`` for 64bit Windows) from the
   official
   `release page <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut/releases/latest>`__. 

2. **Python 2.7 with pip:** Shape-Out can easily be installed with
   `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`__:

   .. code:: bash

       pip install shapeout[GUI]

   Note that ShapeOut requires wxPython 3 and chaco. You might have to
   manually install these for your system if they cannot be installed
   automatically via pip.
   To start Shape-Out, simply run ``python -m shapeout``
   in a command shell. 


Update
======
Shape-Out automatically searches for updates (you may opt-out via the
preferences menu) and notifies the user when a new version is available.

1. **Windows installer:** The older version of Shape-Out will be
   automatically uninstalled when installing a new version.

2. **Python 2.7 and pip:**

   .. code:: bash

       pip uninstall shapeout
       pip install shapeout[GUI]
